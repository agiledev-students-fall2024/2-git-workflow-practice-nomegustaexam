- I find several apps introduced interesting. For example, Waterllama is to remind you to stay hydrated. It allow user set their own goal and choose favorite drinks, have motivational but not too annoying reminders, and come with cute graphics. Yuka is another interesting app where users can scan barcodes or type in a product to get the pros and cons of each item. It also has a safety rating of cosmetics products. I found all these apps interesting.
