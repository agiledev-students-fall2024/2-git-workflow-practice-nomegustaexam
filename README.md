- I find several apps introduced interesting. For example, Waterllama is to remind you to stay hydrated. It allow user set their own goal and choose favorite drinks, have motivational but not too annoying reminders, and come with cute graphics. Yuka is another interesting app where users can scan barcodes or type in a product to get the pros and cons of each item. It also has a safety rating of cosmetics products. I found all these apps interesting.

- With so many recalls and issues with quality controls in the food indsutry lately, Yuka definitely sounds like a very helpful tool to have and I am very keen on checking it out now. Another app in the article that I find interesting is Fabulous which I will also be downloading immeditely. The app aims at helping people build better habits and, at least according to the creators, is backed by behvaioral science research. Definitely seems like something I've been looking for lately.
